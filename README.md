# Product-Launch

Created a plan, identified the launch risks, and figured out how to minimize their impact on your launch. Collaborated with a variety of teams including Marketing, Sales, Customer Support, and more to prepare them to interface with customers as the product was launched. Executed the launch and used feedback from customers to determine the next steps for product.

Problem:
Doordash is looking to automate food delivery using self-driving robots for trips that are less than 2 miles in order to reduce its operating costs and provide more reliable delivery times.

Task was to build a tool for the operations team-- to view the status of deliveries and remotely take control of robots that need intervention (ie: rerouting).
